### It is recommended to use [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) or [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html) to subscribe to this rule to achieve the best ad filtering effect! 🐼

<br />
<br />

## About

Using Adblock syntax, it fights (blocks) various rogue ad SDKs in Android apps at the network level and prevents them from loading, so as to achieve the purpose of de-advertising.

Compared with other means of removing ads, this way of filtering from the network level is low-cost, easy and quick to use, and has a wide range of benefits (e.g., router deployment). You don't need to set up a separate setup for each app on demand, and it doesn't affect your normal use of the original apps while filtering senselessly.

 *Typically, you only need to subscribe to the "Normal" version(AWAvenue-Ads-Rule), the "Strict" version is mainly for exploring, and the Strict version subscription interferes with your normal browsing of the web, so please don't subscribe to this rule unless you know exactly what you're doing!*

 *If you still find the in-app rogue ads sdk displaying ads normally after subscribing to this ad rule, you are welcome to enter the group for feedback!*
