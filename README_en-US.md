### It is recommended to use [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) or [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html) to subscribe to this rule to achieve the best ad filtering effect! üêº

<br />

## About

Using Adblock syntax, it fights (blocks) various rogue ad SDKs in Android apps at the network level and prevents them from loading, so as to achieve the purpose of de-advertising.

Compared with other means of removing ads, this way of filtering from the network level is low-cost, easy and quick to use, and has a wide range of benefits (e.g., router deployment). You don't need to set up a separate setup for each app on demand, and it doesn't affect your normal use of the original apps while filtering senselessly.
